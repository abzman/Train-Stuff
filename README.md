The CN locomotive uses a Vanguard 380447-0079-E1 engine

That engine uses a briggs 808626 carb

that carb is spec'd for a 842875 overhaul kit

that kit is superceded by the 842873 overhaul kit

that engine also uses the 690950 intake gasket

and the 692087 air cleaner gasket

The CN locomotive's power system is strange.  Nothing cuts spark, the fuel flow is interrupted by a solenoid on the carb by the stop switch on the control box.
